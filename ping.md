The ping command is to used on router Q  to verify the accessibility of Host P. And in this case, the Host P may appear to be perfectly accessible.

ping on router Q show the Host P is accessible, which means the ping is receiving replies.

To send ICMP echo messages generated by ping, the router uses the interface that is closest to the destination.In this case, the interface is s0 (serial 0), which is directly connected to segment2. 

    When Host P replies, the replies are sent to the IP addr that is configed on the interface Serial0.
    //... this is why config og static routing is required.
    
so if the Host P wanna send ICMP datagram to the destination of the IP addr config on interface Ethernet0 of Router Q, Host P will face the timeout, and the datagrams are dropped, beacause Router P does have no route for this network. (Interconnection of segments.)
